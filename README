This is my .vim directory and my .vimrc


To get this whole thing working simply:

  1) remove or merge your previous .vimrc /.gvimrc files into mine
  2) clone this repo as .vim in your home directory.
  3) create a symlink to .vimrc in your newly created .vim repo
  4) boot vim


Some changes might cause errors on git commits to remedy simply supply a direct path to the terminal version
of vim via: 

git config --global core.editor /usr/bin/vim
