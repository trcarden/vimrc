This is my .vim directory and my .vimrc


To get this whole thing working simply:

  1) remove or merge your previous .vimrc /.gvimrc files into mine
  2) create a symlink in your home directory that points to the one in your .vim folder / git clone


Some changes might cause errors on git commits to remedy simply supply a direct path to the terminal version
of vim via: 

git config --global core.editor /usr/bin/vim
